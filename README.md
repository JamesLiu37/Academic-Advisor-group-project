# Academic Advisor

Academic Advisor is an Android app that aggregates data from the UW-Madison Course Guide, the UW Registrar's Grade Distribution, and RateMyProfessors into a backend server hosted on a server machine and domain owned by Tyler O'Connell. The app allows you to search for courses in UW-Madison based on data from all the 3 sources, acting as a convenient one-stop shop for students to enroll in courses.
